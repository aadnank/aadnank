### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm **Adnan Khan**, a software engineer based in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ from the University of New Brunswick.

Iâ€™ve explored software from multiple angles â€” engineering, reliability, and security â€” across both public and private sectors. I enjoy understanding how to build large-scale systems, utilizing the latest frameworks and technologies.

These days, Iâ€™m diving into platform engineering, writing custom MCP servers, and obsessing over clean, scalable infra. I enjoy creating things from the ground up â€” and watching them run, reliably.

Outside of tech, I love watching F1 races and game my way through the off-season. Always up to chat about systems, servers, or strategy.
